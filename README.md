## Development server

Run `npx nx serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `npx nx generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npx nx build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

I recommend using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to avoid CORS issues. 

## Running unit tests

Run `npx nx test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npx nx e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
